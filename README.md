As a team, we created a database for our model company, Threadly Inc. 
Threadly Inc. is centered around providing a holistic database structure that caters to the apparel 
industry's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The platform seeks to integrate consumers, 
suppliers, employees, and transporters together in one coordinated, user-friendly system, ensuring 
smooth operation throughout all business areas.
This project's scope for Threadly Inc. includes implementing a structured database system to 
replace legacy and manual methods for managing business records like inventory tracking, sales, 
and customer information. The project focuses on optimizing business processes for better 
efficiency, reduced errors, and unlocking scalable growth potential for SMEs in the apparel 
industry.
